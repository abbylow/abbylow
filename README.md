Hey there, welcome to my Github 👋

## 👩🏻‍💻 Web3 Software Engineer | Indie Hacker 
As a freelance software engineer rooted in frontend development, I'm playfully wading through the smart contract waters - still learning, but loving the swim 🏊. 

Passionate about staying ahead in the tech world, particularly with the latest in AIGC.

I juggle code and nurture dreams of launching my own venture – envisioning a future where I build my own dream empire.
