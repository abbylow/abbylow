Hey there, welcome to my Github 👋

## 👩🏻‍💻 Web3 Software Engineer | Indie Hacker 
As a freelance software engineer rooted in frontend development, I'm playfully wading through the smart contract waters - still learning, but loving the swim 🏊. 

Passionate about staying ahead in the tech world, particularly with the latest in AIGC.

I juggle code and nurture dreams of launching my own venture – envisioning a future where I build my own dream empire.

## 🚧 WIP Projects
- [Wine marketplace](https://wine-biz.vercel.app/) (Halted) - Built with NextJs | TailwindCSS | Shadcn UI | Vercel

  This project showcases my frontend development skills, including CSS styling, the utilization of UI frameworks, responsive design, and cross-browser compatibility. The project is currently a work in progress, featuring only a placeholder frontend for now.
- [Juku - a social technology platform to connect Learners and Subject Matter Experts](https://juku.vercel.app/) - Built with Thirdweb Connect | Lit Protocol | Orbis Social | IPFS | NextJs | TailwindCSS | Shadcn UI | Vercel
  
  This project highlights my expertise in frontend development and my proficiency in integrating Web3 technologies, such as connecting a wallet / web2 social SSO using ThirdWeb SDK. It demonstrates my capability in building a decentralized application (DApp) on the decentralized social graph, Orbis Social, and securing user data through encryption with Lit Protocol. Currently a work in progress, several features are still in the development phase.
